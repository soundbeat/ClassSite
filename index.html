        The 2 important parts to capturing a photograph - &ndash; &mdash; the subject and the location.

        &ldquo;Adele and John&rdquo; wanted some wedding photos of just
        themselves around Sydney Harbour with the <em>Sydney Opera House, Botanical
        Gardens</em> and <em>Sydney Harbour Bridge</em> as the backdrop. We met up with them
        one sunny afternoon on the Sydney Opera House steps and spent some time
        capturing some greats shots of them both in these awe-inspiring locations.
        After shooting in front of the <em>Opera House and Bridge</em>, we walked into
        <em>Sydney's Botanical Gardens</em> with the city behind them and captured some
        great natural moments between the two of them. After a glass or two of
        Champagne, we wandered through the gardens to <em>Mrs Macquaries Point</em> and
        photographed the bride and groom with the iconic <em>Opera House</em> and <em>Harbour
        Bridge</em> behind them.

        &quot;Jane and Richard's wedding&quot; was at St. Wilfrid's
        Church, Calverley and the wedding reception took place at the <em>Mercure Parkway
        Hotel, Leeds</em>. All the groomsmen were in kilts as the groom is Scottish and there
        was definitely a Scottish theme to the day. After the ceremony we were lucky enough
        for some sunshine to come out just at the right moment so the bride and groom
        could have the <strong>roof down</strong> on the wedding car. We worked quickly in the short
        time we had sun to capture some great photos of the bride and groom through
        the trees with the sunshine behind outside the <em>Mercure Parkway Hotel</em>. The
        wedding speeches had everyone in stitches as the best man had prepared a
        slide-show of photos from the stag do!
